# Backports are recompiled packages from testing (mostly) and unstable (in
# a few cases only, e.g. security updates) in a stable environment so that
# they will run without new libraries (whenever it is possible) on a Debian
# stable distribution.  Due to https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=714726
# stable-backports will cause apt to give a warning, so we use the named backport.

# Unstable is where packages go after they've been uploaded by the maintainer,
# and cleared for release by the FTP master.  When packages have met certain
# criteria, they are automatically moved from unstable to the current "testing" branch.
